DND OPEN RULES NOTES: 
-see http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd for
quick info on what you can and can't do with the SRD/OGL

-you can use .text-truncate for dynamic elipses on text (source:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/framework/typography)

VUETIFY LAYOUT:
-from their examples, it seems that you are generally expected to wrap
components in one v-container (no nested v-containers) and then use v-layout
from there. also keep in mind that they accept many of the same props but with
some key differences.

VUETIFY COLORS:
-"Each color from the spec gets converted to a background and text variant for
styling within your application through a class, e.g. <div class="red"> or <span
class="red--text">"

VUETIFY TOOLBAR:
-dense seems to only have an effect on xs screen sizes (possibly some larger
sizes as well - didn't test)

REFACTORING:
-use mixins to define global constants (like your theme color names)

VUETIFY CENTERING:

VUETIFY NAVIGATION DRAWER:
-"Using null as the starting value for its v-model will initialize the drawer as
closed on mobile and as open on desktop."
