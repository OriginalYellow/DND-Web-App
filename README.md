# A Little DND Site

A little project for practicing Vue.js, webpack, and various backend thingies once I get to it.

## Setup

Just clone and run ```npm install```

## Running

Run ```npm run start``` to start the dev server. Saving files while the dev server is running will recompile and reload the bundle.
